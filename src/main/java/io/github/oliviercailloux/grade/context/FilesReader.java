/**
 * An abstraction over file hierarchies, which can be provided by the network (a
 * GitHub repository), a cache of file contents in memory (previously fetched
 * from GitHub), a git repository on the local hard disk, â€¦
 *
 * The key for accessing a file is a Path, and those paths are always relative
 * to the project root.
 *
 * TODO the key should be a URL or some other means equivalent to a Path but
 * file-system independent, so that it can equally represent a relative path on
 * a web server or on a disk. Currently I suppose on Windows a path for
 * retrieving from a file system would use '\' and thus would fail if used for
 * retrieving content on the web. Although I can perhaps follow the JDK advice
 * by resolving systematically against the root path, if the root path is right
 * (using '/' on the web and '\' on a Windows file system), it should work.
 * Except that the git client uses only '/' for its path separation.
