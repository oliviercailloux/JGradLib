/**

 *
 * TreeGrade implements MarksTree
 *
 * â€“ Map<CritPath, Mark> // no extensions: no paths p1, p2 such that p2 extends
 * p1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Generally goes logically together with a GradeAggregator (because similar
 * structures are required for aggregation to be possible), but code may be
 * simpler with a grade object alone; and this class may be useful for more
 * fundamental purposes such as collecting marks given by various graders with
 * no specific aggregation purpose in mind; or using a logical categorization of
 * grades that differs from the aggregating structure.
